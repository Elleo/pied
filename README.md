Pied makes it simple to install and manage text-to-speech [Piper](https://github.com/rhasspy/piper) voices for use with [Speech Dispatcher](https://freebsoft.org/speechd). Pied installs and configures the Piper neural text-to-speech engine to
work with Speech Dispatcher. It can then be used to download and manage different voices.
